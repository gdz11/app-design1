## Angular Components Assignment: Breaking Down a Website into Reusable Components

### Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to help you understand how to decompose a web page into reusable Angular components. Each team will be assigned a website/web app (via email) to break down into smaller, reusable components, enhancing modularity, readability, and reusability in web development.

### Instructions:

1. Component Analysis:  
  Identify different parts of the page/app that can be considered separate components and reusable parts.  
  Break the pages into as many components as necessary (to be reusable but not bloated), ensuring that the components follow the principles of reusability and modularity.  
2. Create a Component Breakdown Diagram:  
  Design a visual representation of how the website can be structured in terms of components. This can be a simple sketch or a digital wireframe, clearly showing how each part of the page will be handled by a specific component. Alternatively, you can outline component borders on a screenshot of the website/app (see the provided example: component-sample.png). Each team should break down at least three pages of the given website, with each team member responsible for at least one page.
3. Presentation:  
  Prepare a short presentation (5 minutes) where you will walk us through your chosen design of component breakdown, and your reasoning behind the design decisions.  
  Focus on explaining how the components can enhance the modularity and reusability of the page. Each team member will present the page they have worked on.

Feel free to ask questions if you need clarification.
